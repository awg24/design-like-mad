# Design Like Mad

Organizations can have an issue when receiving lots of applicants for a specific event where they need to sorted into groups. The problems arised when there's about 70+ people that need to be sorted and get matched in an appropiate group. What this project will accomplish is to automate everything, so that all organizer's job is to rate the applicants/non-profits and click submit to have the sorting done for them.
