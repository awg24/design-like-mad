# Design Like Mad

Design like mad is an event that is hosted in multiple cities where designers and non-profits can come to together and create amazing designs. The issue that arises for the hosts is the amount of people that apply. It's is often time consuming trying to get these people grouped together into groups where people of varying skill can compliment each other. The current format in which people apply is through a third party website, so my plan for this site is to provide a way for applicants to easily apply and for the hosts to easily rate and rank both applicants and non-profits so that they may be sorted automatically, and not by hand which how it is currently being done.
