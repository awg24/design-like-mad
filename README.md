# design-like-mad

Desgin like mad is an event that organizations, non-profits, professionals, 
and students can sign up for. The goal of this project is to solve an issue of sorting through large volumes 
of applicants, and non-profits. 

Non-profits will be ranked based on description, and the "fit" for the specific event hosted by the organization
, top 15 (exact number isn't concrete).

applicants will be ranked based on their skill as determined by the organization. 

Each non-profit selected will have a project to work on which will have a certain "type" associated with it
and applicants will be sorted into those groups if they are of matching "type" (or similar) and each group will have differeing level of skills which is based on the organization's members. Each group will have at least one student.
